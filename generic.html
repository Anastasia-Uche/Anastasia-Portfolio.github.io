                        I’m a data analyst who’s passionate about turning data into insights that spark real change. From building dashboards to uncovering hidden trends, I enjoy helping businesses make smarter decisions with the power of data.

                        I’m currently diving deeper into machine learning and always exploring new ways to apply data science for business growth and impact.

                        My toolbox includes Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn), SQL, Power BI, and Excel, along with a growing knowledge of machine learning techniques and data storytelling.

                        When I’m not analyzing data, you’ll probably find me learning something new, writing (both technical content and the occasional fiction story), mentoring aspiring analysts, or playing with my cat.
